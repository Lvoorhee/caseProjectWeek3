                <p>From the director who brought you the films <b>NASA</b> and <b>The Mud Man</b> Phil Johnson has created another smash hit. 
                <b>The Bears</b> is the directors fifth film. With a massive budget of 187 million dollars the film is lining up to be his
                biggest creation to date. Shot deep in the Manitoba wilderness over a two week shoot the film is shot completely off set.
                The cast and crew endured treacherous conditions in order to convey a more realistic performance. <b>The Bears</b> is coming soon to
                a theater near you.
